Agent: Your battery is low, so charging soon is important. You have a grocery shopping task at the Grocery Store. There is a GreenCharge Station very close to the Grocery Store, just 0.5 miles away. You can charge your car there while doing your shopping. 

Another option is the OfficeCharge Spot near your work location, only 0.2 miles away, which could be convenient if you want to charge before or after going to work.

I recommend the GreenCharge Station at 123 Green St because you can conveniently charge while doing your grocery shopping, saving time. Would you like directions to this station or more options?
